# Pepper WKZ Buddy

This project was done as part of the minor Social Robotics from University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht. As an end result of this project, a paper was written which can be found at: (Will be added once Paper has been published...)

The Pepper WKZ Buddy contains the following features:
- 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
